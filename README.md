# exoplanet

Problem Statement: To find corelation between exoplanets and their host stars. 

Dataset used: NASA exoplanet archive https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=planets

Work completed: Literature survey for exoplanet properties. To plot various graphs betweeen planet properties and star properties. Studying the dataset for anamolies. To search a ML/DL algorithm suitable for training on the dataset. 

TO DO: Implement Neural Network on Star Mass and Planet Mass and find more such couples of properties to include them in the NN.
